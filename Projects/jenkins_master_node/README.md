# Adding the Remote Agent to Jenkins Master

![arch](jenkins.png)

With Jenkins you can automate anything. In my case My Master and Agent are running on Digital Cloud. Configure Agent Node in Jenkins.

SSH Connection (the better way)
Step 1 — Set up Jenkins Master instance, install java 11 and jenkins

Step 2 — Set up Jenkins Agent instance

Then create a key pair for this user.
